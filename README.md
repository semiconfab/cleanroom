    * PVE201 PARTICULATE MATTER & AIR QUALITY TRANSMITTER (or equivalent)
    * High sensitivity
    * Real-time data output
    * Network connectivity
    * Additional sensors for comprehensive coverage (if required)
* **Decontamination System:**
    * Air filtration unit
    * UV germicidal lamp system
    * Control interface compatible with chosen communication protocol
* **Industrial-grade Ethernet Switch:**
    * Reliable communication between devices
    * PoE (Power over Ethernet) for specific sensors
    * Hardened construction

**Optional Hardware:**

* **Air Quality Sensors:** Temperature, humidity, VOCs monitoring.
* **Cameras (optional):** Visual inspection and AI-powered image analysis.
    * Industrial cameras with sealed housings.
* **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS):** Power backup for cleanroom integrity.

**Software:**

* **AI Software:** Custom-developed or pre-trained solution for particle detection/classification.
* **Industrial Automation Software:** Data acquisition, decontamination control, visualization.

**Communication Protocol:**

* Modbus RTU, Profinet, EtherCAT (ensure compatibility).

**Data Security:**

* Secure data transmission protocols and access controls.

**Scalability:**

* Consider modular or upgradable hardware for future expansion.

## ML System Design

This section outlines a possible Machine Learning (ML) system design for the project:

**1. Data Acquisition:**

* Real-time particle count data from PVE201 and potentially additional sensors.
* Preprocessing (cleaning, normalization).

**2. Anomaly Detection Model:**

* Anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, LOF, OCSVM).
* Learns "normal" particle behavior and flags deviations as potential contamination.
* Training data: Historical data of particle counts representing "clean" conditions with labeled contamination events (if available).

**3. Decontamination Activation Logic:**

* Thresholding on anomaly score for decontamination activation.
* Spatial reasoning (clustering/geospatial analysis) for pinpointing contamination location (if multiple sensors).

**4. Model Training and Deployment:**

* Train-Test Split for model evaluation.
* Continuous learning mechanisms for model adaptation.
* Deployment on Industrial PC for real-time processing and decontamination triggering.
